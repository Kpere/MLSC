Multi-Label Stock Classifier

The "Multi-Label Stock Classifier" is a reproducible work aimed at classifying price movements into three categories: buy, sell, or hold for each corresponding stock. This work explores the concept of simultaneous multi-horizon price movement prediction compared to binary market movement classification. By predicting price movements across multiple time horizons, traders can make informed decisions adjusted for specific trading strategies.
